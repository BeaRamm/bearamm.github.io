I am currently a fellow at the Center for the Physics of Biological function ([CPBF](https://biophysics.princeton.edu/)) at Princeton University. Before coming to Princeton, I was a PhD student in the Department of Cellular and Molecular Biophysics at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry ([MPIB](https://www.biochem.mpg.de/schwille)) while enrolled in the Graduate School of Quantitative Biosciences Munich ([QBM](https://qbm.genzentrum.lmu.de/)).

I am fascinated by spatiotemporal organization in biology and how it arises from a mixture of biochemical and physical and mechanical factors. Self-organization phenomena that give rise to biological pattern formation exhibit unexpected and complex behaviour often impossible to predict from the individual components. This can be observed across all scales of life, from compositionally simple bacterial systems reconstituted <i>in vitro</i> to the complex architecture of the eukaryotic cell, to the elaborate multicellular patterns that form during the development of higher organisms.

I contribute to our understanding of pattern formation in biology with an interdisciplinary approach at the interface of biochemistry, biophysics and synthetic biology. To this end I employ quantitative analysis, systematic probing and precise perturbation, as well as curious and careful observation with an open mind for the experimental outcome.
