  abstract = {{Cell division is spatiotemporally precisely regulated, but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. In the social, predatory bacterium Myxococcus xanthus, the PomX/PomY/PomZ proteins form a single large megadalton-sized complex that directly positions and stimulates cytokinetic ring formation by the tubulin homolog FtsZ. Here, we studied the structure and mechanism of this complex in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that PomY forms liquid-like biomolecular condensates by phase separation, while PomX self-assembles into filaments generating a single large cellular structure. The PomX structure enriches PomY, thereby guaranteeing the formation of precisely one PomY condensate per cell through surface-assisted condensation. In vitro, PomY condensates selectively enrich FtsZ and nucleate GTP-dependent FtsZ polymerization, suggesting a novel cell division site positioning mechanism in which the single PomY condensate enriches FtsZ to guide FtsZ-ring formation and division. PomY-nucleated FtsZ polymerization shares features with microtubule nucleation by biomolecular condensates in eukaryotes, supporting this mechanism’s ancient origin.}},

abstract = {{The spatiotemporal regulation of cell division is a fundamental issue in cell biology. Bacteria have evolved a variety of different systems to achieve proper division site placement. In many cases, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still incompletely understood. In this study, we investigate the function of the cell division regulator MipZ from Caulobacter crescentus, a P-loop ATPase that inhibits the polymerization of the treadmilling tubulin homolog FtsZ near the cell poles, thereby limiting the assembly of the cytokinetic Z ring to the midcell region. We show that MipZ interacts with FtsZ in both its monomeric and polymeric forms and induces the disassembly of FtsZ polymers in a manner that is not dependent but enhanced by the FtsZ GTPase activity. Using a combination of biochemical and genetic approaches, we then map the MipZ–FtsZ interaction interface. Our results reveal that MipZ employs a patch of surface-exposed hydrophobic residues to interact with the C-terminal region of the FtsZ core domain. In doing so, it sequesters FtsZ monomers and caps the (+)-end of FtsZ polymers, thereby promoting their rapid disassembly. We further show that MipZ influences the conformational dynamics of interacting FtsZ molecules, which could potentially contribute to modulating their assembly kinetics. Together, our findings show that MipZ uses a combination of mechanisms to control FtsZ polymerization, which may be required to robustly regulate the spatiotemporal dynamics of Z ring assembly within the cell.}},

ParABS ensures a high degree of fidelity in inheritance by dividing the genetic material equally between daughter cells during cell division. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the assembly of the partition complex, representing the core of the ParABS system, are still far from being understood. Here we demonstrate that the partition complex is formed via liquid–liquid phase separation. Assembly of the partition complex is initiated by the formation of oligomeric ParB species, which in turn are regulated by CTP-binding. Phase diagrams and in vivo analysis show how the partition complex can further be spatially regulated by parS. By investigating the phylogenetic variation in phase separation and its regulation by CTP, we find a high degree of evolutionary conservation among distantly related prokaryotes. These results advance the understanding of partition complex formation and regulation in general, by confirming and extending recently proposed models.}},

We applied this approach to the highly nonlinear reaction cycles underlying MinDE protein self-organization.

 abstract = {{The healthy growth and maintenance of a biological system depends on the precise spatial organization of molecules within the cell through the dissipation of energy. Reaction–diffusion mechanisms can facilitate this organization, as can directional cargo transport orchestrated by motor proteins, by relying on specific protein interactions. However, transport of material through the cell can also be achieved by active processes based on non-specific, purely physical mechanisms, a phenomenon that remains poorly explored. Here, using a combined experimental and theoretical approach, we discover and describe a hidden function of the Escherichia coli MinDE protein system: in addition to forming dynamic patterns, this system accomplishes the directional active transport of functionally unrelated cargo on membranes. Remarkably, this mechanism enables the sorting of diffusive objects according to their effective size, as evidenced using modular DNA origami–streptavidin nanostructures. We show that the diffusive fluxes of MinDE and non-specific cargo couple via density-dependent friction. This non-specific process constitutes a diffusiophoretic mechanism, as yet unknown in a cell biology setting. This nonlinear coupling between diffusive fluxes could represent a generic physical mechanism for establishing intracellular organization. Protein oscillations linked to cell division in Escherichia coli are shown to localize unrelated molecules on the cell membrane via a diffusiophoretic mechanism, in which an effective friction fosters cargo transport along the fluxes set up by the proteins.}},

The exact molecular mechanisms enabling MinDE self-organization, and particularly the role of cooperativity in the membrane binding of MinD, thought to be a key requirement, have remained poorly understood. However, for bottom-up synthetic biology aiming at a de novo design of key cellular features, elucidating these mechanisms is of great relevance. By combining in vitro reconstitution with rationally guided mutagenesis of MinD, we found that when bound to membranes, MinD displays new interfaces for multimerization, which are distinct from the canonical MinD dimerization site. We propose that these additional transient interactions contribute to the local self-enhancement of MinD at the membrane, while their relative lability maintains the structural plasticity required for MinDE wave propagation. This could represent a powerful structural regulation feature not reported so far for self-organizing proteins.}},

The processes leading to spatiotemporal patterns often involve a multitude of molecules interacting in complex networks, so that only very few cellular pattern-forming systems can be regarded as well understood. Due to its compositional simplicity, the Escherichia coli MinCDE system has, thus, become a paradigm for protein pattern formation. This biological reaction diffusion system spatiotemporally positions the division machinery in E. coli and is closely related to ParA-type ATPases involved in most aspects of spatiotemporal organization in bacteria. The ATPase MinD and the ATPase-activating protein MinE self-organize on the membrane as a reaction matrix. In vivo, these two proteins typically oscillate from pole-to-pole, while in vitro they can form a variety of distinct patterns. MinC is a passenger protein supposedly operating as a downstream cue of the system, coupling it to the division machinery. The MinCDE system has helped to extract not only the principles underlying intracellular patterns, but also how they are shaped by cellular boundaries. Moreover, it serves as a model to investigate how patterns can confer information through specific and non-specific interactions with other molecules. Here, we review how the three Min proteins self-organize to form patterns, their response to geometric boundaries, and how these patterns can in turn induce patterns of other molecules, focusing primarily on experimental approaches and developments.}},

Here, we demonstrate that the Escherichia coli Min system, known for its oscillatory behavior between the cell poles, is under certain conditions capable of transitioning to quasi-stationary protein distributions on membranes closely resembling Turing patterns. We systematically titrated both proteins, MinD and MinE, and found that removing all purification tags and linkers from the N-terminus of MinE was critical for static patterns to occur. At small bulk heights, dynamic patterns dominate, such as in rod-shaped microcompartments. We see implications of this work for studying pattern formation in general, but also for creating artificial gradients as downstream cues in synthetic biology applications.}},

The periodic relocation of Min proteins from the vesicle lumen to the membrane and back is accompanied by drastic changes in the mechanical properties of the lipid bilayer. In particular, two types of oscillating membrane‐shape changes are highlighted: 1) GUVs that repeatedly undergo fission into two connected compartments and fusion of these compartments back into a dumbbell shape and 2) GUVs that show periodic budding and subsequent merging of the buds with the mother vesicle, accompanied by an overall shape change of the vesicle reminiscent of a bouncing ball.

In vitro reconstitution of such systems allows for detailed studies of their underlying mechanisms which would not be feasible in vivo. Here, we provide a protocol for the in vitro reconstitution of the MinCDE system of Escherichia coli, which positions the cell division septum in the cell middle. The assay is designed to supply only the components necessary for self-organization, namely a membrane, the two proteins MinD and MinE and energy in the form of ATP. We therefore fabricate an open reaction chamber on a coverslip, on which a supported lipid bilayer is formed. The open design of the chamber allows for optimal preparation of the lipid bilayer and controlled manipulation of the bulk content. The two proteins, MinD and MinE, as well as ATP, are then added into the bulk volume above the membrane. Imaging is possible by many optical microscopies, as the design supports confocal, wide-field and TIRF microscopy alike. In a variation of the protocol, the lipid bilayer is formed on a patterned support, on cell-shaped PDMS microstructures, instead of glass. Lowering the bulk solution to the rim of these compartments encloses the reaction in a smaller compartment and provides boundaries that allow mimicking of in vivo oscillatory behavior. Taken together, we describe protocols to reconstitute the MinCDE system both with and without spatial confinement, allowing researchers to precisely control all aspects influencing pattern formation, such as concentration ranges and addition of other factors or proteins, and to systematically increase system complexity in a relatively simple experimental setup.}},

Despite its compositional simplicity, the molecular mechanism leading to protein patterns and oscillations is still insufficiently understood. Here we used high-speed atomic force microscopy to analyze the mechanism of MinDE membrane association/dissociation dynamics on isolated membrane patches, down to the level of individual point oscillators. This nanoscale analysis shows that MinD association to and dissociation from the membrane are both highly cooperative but mechanistically different processes. We propose that they represent the two directions of a single allosteric switch leading to MinD filament formation and depolymerization. Association/dissociation are separated by rather long apparently silent periods. The membrane-associated period is characterized by MinD filament multivalent binding, avidity, while the dissociated period is defined by seeding of individual MinD. Analyzing association/dissociation kinetics with varying MinD and MinE concentrations and dependent on membrane patch size allowed us to disentangle the essential dynamic variables of the MinDE oscillation cycle.}},

The coiled coil was unzipped from its N and C termini. When pulling from the C terminus, we observed that the coiled coil was resistant to force owing to the high stability of the C-terminal region. Pulling from the N terminus revealed that the N-terminal half is considerably less stable. The mechanical pulling assay is a unique tool to study and control seed formation and structure propagation of the coiled coil. We then used rigorous theory-based deconvolution for a model-free extraction of the energy landscape and local stability profiles. The data obtained from the two distinct pulling directions complement each other and reveal a tripartite stability of the coiled coil: a labile N-terminal half, followed by a medium stability section and a highly stable region at the far C-terminal end. The different stability regions provide important insight into the mechanics of IF assembly.}},
